# Speak2Summary

**Speak2Summary** is a Flask-based web application that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to transcribe and summarize meeting audio files. It provides an intuitive interface for users to upload audio recordings and receive concise summaries, facilitating efficient meeting reviews and note-taking.

## Features

* 🎙️ **Audio Transcription**: Convert spoken content from meetings into text using advanced speech-to-text capabilities.
* 🎬 **Video Upload Support**: Upload meeting videos directly and extract audio automatically before transcription.
* 🧠 **Summarization with LLMs**: Generate concise summaries of transcribed text utilizing powerful language models.
* 🧩 **Flexible LLM Providers**: Use cloud models (OpenAI, Groq) or connect to local models through LM Studio or Ollama.
* Mind Map Generation: Create visual representations of meeting summaries to enhance understanding and retention.
* 🖥️ **User-Friendly Interface**: Interact with a clean and responsive web UI built with Flask.
* 🐳 **Dockerized Deployment**: Easily deploy the application using Docker and Docker Compose for a consistent environment setup.

## Prerequisites

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed on your system.
* Valid API keys for:

  * [GROQ API](https://groq.com/)
  * [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/api/)

## Installation and Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/codeperfectplus/Speak2Summary.git
   ```



2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```bash
   cd Speak2Summary
   ```



3. **Set Environment Variables**

   Export your API keys as environment variables:

   ```bash
   export GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   export LOCAL_LLM_API_URL=http://your-local-llm-host:1234
   export LOCAL_LLM_REQUEST_TIMEOUT=900
   export GUNICORN_TIMEOUT=960
   ```



*Replace the placeholder values with your actual keys and local LLM URL. For Ollama, use port 11434. Increase `LOCAL_LLM_REQUEST_TIMEOUT` for slower local models, and keep `GUNICORN_TIMEOUT` higher than that value.*

4. **Build and Run the Docker Container**

   Use Docker Compose to build and start the application:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build -d
   ```



5. **Access the Application**

   Open your web browser and navigate to:

   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   ```
